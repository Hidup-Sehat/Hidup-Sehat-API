# HidupSehat API

The HidupSehat is a FastAPI-based API designed for mobile apps that focus on promoting a healthy lifestyle. Offers seamless integration with Firebase Firestore and Powered by machine learning. Can be accessed at
[Here](https://hidup-sehat-api-oppougulda-as.a.run.app).

## Usage/Examples

To use the HidupSehat API deployed on Cloud Run, follow these steps:

```
curl -X 'GET' \
  'https://hidup-sehat-api-oppougulda-as.a.run.app/v1/weekly-leaderboard' \
  -H 'accept: application/json'
```

The API will respond with the Weekly Leaderboard in JSON format. Here's an example response:

```
{
  "weekEndDate": "18-06-2023",
  "weekStartDate": "12-06-2023",
  "data": [
    {
      "user_uid": "buHJ6rChG0YTZi9FflGC7XZqEek2",
      "username": "Rijal Muhyidin",
      "name": "Rijal Muhyidin",
      "imgUrl": "https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/hidup-sehat-server.appspot.com/o/blank-profile.png?alt=media&token=416c3ef1-8c69-453c-b9c6-e35e390102b8&_gl=1*1z115oz*_ga*MjAzMzY5MDczOC4xNjg1MDM0NTY1*_ga_CW55HF8NVT*MTY4NjQxMTQyOC4yNC4xLjE2ODY0MTIyNjUuMC4wLjA.",

## How we Deploy it

These are the step to deploy on Cloud Run:

1.  Make sure you join the **capstone-hidup-sehat** Google Cloud project
2.  Go to the [Cloud Run Section](https://console.cloud.google.com/run) in Google Cloud
3.  Click create service
4.  Click on Continuously deploy new revisions from a source repository and click on Set Up with Cloud Build
5.  Use github as source repository and choose **Hidup-Sehat/Hidup-Sehat-API** as the repository then click next
6.  Choose the branch and use Dockerfile as build type then just leave Source Location by default
7.  Change the Service name and the region as it should
8.  To avoid high billing, choose **CPU is only allocated during request processing** and set the Minimum number of instances to **0** and the Maximum number of instances to **5**. (You can set the maximum to around 5-10)
9.  Choose **All** for Ingress Control
10. Set **Allow unauthenticated invocations** to make our API public
11. Configure env as it should
12. Click create and wait
13. The project should be deployed
