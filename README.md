# HidupSehat API

The HidupSehat is a FastAPI-based API designed for mobile apps that focus on promoting a healthy lifestyle. Powered by machine learning, it offers seamless integration with Firebase Firestore. Can be accessed at 
[Here](https://apihidupsehat.my.id/docs).
## Usage/Examples

To use the HidupSehat API deployed on Cloud Run, follow these steps:

```
curl -X 'GET' \
  'https://apihidupsehat.my.id/v1/weekly-leaderboard' \
  -H 'accept: application/json'
```
The API will respond with the Weekly Leaderboard in JSON format. Here's an example response:
```
{
  "weekEndDate": "18-06-2023",
  "weekStartDate": "12-06-2023",
  "data": [
    {
      "user_uid": "buHJ6rChG0YTZi9FflGC7XZqEek2",
      "username": "Rijal Muhyidin",
      "name": "Rijal Muhyidin",
      "imgUrl": "https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/hidup-sehat-server.appspot.com/o/blank-profile.png?alt=media&token=416c3ef1-8c69-453c-b9c6-e35e390102b8&_gl=1*1z115oz*_ga*MjAzMzY5MDczOC4xNjg1MDM0NTY1*_ga_CW55HF8NVT*MTY4NjQxMTQyOC4yNC4xLjE2ODY0MTIyNjUuMC4wLjA.",

}
```

## Deployment

These are the step to deploy on Cloud Run:
1.  Make sure you join the **capstone-hidup-sehat** Google Cloud project
2.  Go to the [Cloud Run Section](https://console.cloud.google.com/run) in Google Cloud
3.  Click create service
4.  Click on Continuously deploy new revisions from a source repository and click on Set Up with Cloud Build
5.  Use github as source repository and choose **Hidup-Sehat/Hidup-Sehat-API** as the repository then click next
6.  Choose the branch and use Dockerfile as build type then just leave Source Location by default
7.  Change the Service name and the region as it should
8.  To avoid high billing, choose __CPU is only allocated during request processing__ and set the Minimum number of instances to __0__ and the Maximum number of instances to __5__. (You can set the maximum to around 5-10)
9.  Choose __All__ for Ingress Control
10. Set __Allow unauthenticated invocations__ to make our API public
11. Click create and wait
12. The project should be deployed
